// Rules on error reporting over the Ledger API
//
// 1. We use gRPC status codes to report synchronous success and failures
//    coming from the underlying gRPC protocol and at the API level.
//    Asynchronous API-level errors are reported over a completion stream like the command completion stream,
//    which themselves include a `google.rpc.Status` message to indicate the status.
//    The status code `OK` denotes success.
//
// 2. Error reporting includes relevant error details in the `details` field of the status message,
//    following the gRPC rich error model as described at https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors#error_model.
//    Error details use the `google.rpc.ErrorInfo` message defined at
//    https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/rpc/error_details.proto#L112.
//    Its `reason` field includes an error code.
//    Further details on the error and information for subsequent API usage may be included in `metadata`
//    The RPC documentation may document further metadata of the error that applications should
//
// 3. RPC requests can specify that the API-level error details of the RPC response shall be JSON-encoded in the error message
//    instead of using the `details` field by setting the flag `error_details_in_message` in the RPC request message to `true`.
//    If an application cannot read the error details from the trailers, e.g. because some middleware drops them,
//    it can obtain the details by parsing the message. This flag does not affect the errors coming from the underlying gRPC protocol.
//    Neither does this flag affect asynchronous errors reported as part of completions.
